LCARS SDK 19182.4
============

The LCARS SDK is a UI/UX source development kit and environment umbrella designed specifically for generating functional interfaces with the LCARS methodology within a webview.  Utilizing a webview the LCARS SDK can be applied to cross-modern internet browsers, both mobile and desktop applications.  Anywhere a webview is in place the LCARS SDK could be utilized.

V4 Update is an entire rewrite of the library.  It is not backwards compatiable and is no properly stored proptotyped objects, data driven and designed for easy data connectors.  

Included:

1. Illustrator files for mockups and direct sizing porting.
2. Base CSS which is the minimal requirement to utilize the LCARS methodology.
3. JS API which is optional but useful for creating, managing and maintaining the interfaces.

Example Interfaces will be provided at a later date.
