============

The LCARS SDK is a development kit and environment umbrella designed specifically for generating canon quality and functional LCARS interfaces within a webview.  Utilizing a webview the LCARS SDK can be applied to cross-modern internet browsers and both mobile and desktop applications.  Anywhere a webview is in place the SDK could be used.

While the Code core could be written without a library, to make it more accessible the $.(); syntax is used via the Zepto.js library.  jQuery may be used as a drop-in replacement preference.

Included in the current version of the SDK is the Code core, addon(s) and base templating vector file(s).
